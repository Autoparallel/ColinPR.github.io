        <h5><i>
            As a mathematician, I am interested in physical problems and geometry.  In my mind, the linkage between these two components is through partial differential equations (PDEs). PDEs are typically studied in an analytical sense with boundary value problems posed on subregions in n-dimensional Eucliean space.  However, the coordinate free perspective granted by Riemannian geometry may provide new insights or techniques to make progress in both old and new problems.

              <b>  Mathematical Physics </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Physics is an experimental and theoretical science. It lies in the balance of theory being confirmed by experiment while experiment may drave theory. The realm of theoretical physics is concerned with finding mathematical theories that describe our world in ways we will (hopefully) assert via experimentation.
        </p>
            
        <p>
        Mathematical physics is a broad subject. I like to think of it as dual to theoretical physics in that a mathematical physicist expands the mathematics found in the theoretical models that physicist create.  A mathematician is concerned with the rigor of the mathematics being correct, whereas a physicist cares about the model working properly. Hence, there is indeed a gap that must be filled in order for the mathematics to be well-posed.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            <b> Riemannian Geometry </b>
        </h3>
            
        <p>
        In the early years of an undergraduate degree, STEM students study calculus.  Those who need it, study calculus in higher dimensions (most likely 3-dimensions).  But, this calculus is restricted to the study of objects that sit naturally inside of an n-dimensional Euclidean space.  For one, this limits the scientist on, for example, the 3-dimensional domains they may study (as not all can be embedded nicely in 3-dimensional space). Moreover, this also forces one's hand in placing extrinsic coordinate representations onto their spaces. This is not ideal.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In comes the helping hand of Riemannian geometry.  For me, Riemannian geometry is the suitable generalization of Euclidean spaces to include their non-Euclidean cousins.  As a benefit, one receives an intrinsic theory of the domain of interest and many concepts are readily generalized with no mention of coordinate representations.
        </p>

                <b> Partial Differential Equations </b>
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        The world around us is a complex dyamical beast.  One such way of capturing the behavior of model systems is through PDEs.  A motivating example is the model of heat flow on a piece of ice where heat is being pumped into the ice through its boundary.  Even such a simple system can become complex. Yet, in order to be able to solve such models, we make simplifying assumptions (the cube is homogeneous in specific heat, it cannot melt, and it is nicely shaped). When we remove such restrictions, we find ourselves in the realm of numerical PDEs and computing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        PDEs are also highly geometrical as one finds the relationships causing dynamics to be intimately connected to the structure of the domain of interest.  In the previous example, we can imagine the crystaline structure of ice allows one to understand the routes that energy must flow, and it is through this geometric information that we are capturing change. ADD IN STUFF ON VIBRATION AS THAT IS VERY GEOMETRIC!

        <h3>
                <b> Variational Methods </b>
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        Many problems arize via optimization.  For example, what is the smallest soap film that spans a given loop of wire.  This problem can be phrased as finding the surface with least area with a fixed boundary.  In this sense, one is then trying to find the optimal function in the infinite dimensional space of all functions with prescribed boundary values such that this function minimizes an area functional.To solve this problem, we must find the critical points of the functional.  This we do by taking a variation of the functional, which is analogous to finding critical points for functions (which we do in a first semester calculus course).  This process can then output a PDE in which the optimum function is a solution.
       </p>
       
       <p>
       On top of being a natural way to phrase a question, variational principles can help make symmetries of an equation more clear. For example, if a functional depends on the norm of the input function, then it can be clearly seen that a unitary group acting on the space of functions does not affect the value of the functional. This specific example arises in the Lagrangian for the electromagnetic field.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
                <b> Geometric Algebra </b>
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        Geometric algebra plays the role of properly generalizing the Helmholtz 3-dimensional vector algebra as well as the exterior algebra of Grassmann.  Typically, a student learns the usual notions for vector products and differentials in 3-dimensional space, but will be given few tools to generalize these to arbitrary dimension. Two key examples are the lack of a clear-cut notion of curl and of the cross product in spaces of dimension other than three.
        </p>
        <p>
        All is not lost, as the exterior algebra more rigorously defines these notions in higher dimensions.  However, the exterior algebra is lacking in the other half of the story. Namely, the notions of interior products.  Geometric algebra includes this case and provides a beautiful geometric interpretation for a geometric product of multivectors.  By doing so, we gain an ability to work with physical problems in terms of multivectors in quadratic spaces of arbitrary signature.  Thus, one can formulate physical problems in a relativistic sense with the flip of a switch. Coming with this perspective is a new understanding of what certain physical quantities should represent. I see geometric algebra as a means for writing a more unified and interpretable langauge for physics.
