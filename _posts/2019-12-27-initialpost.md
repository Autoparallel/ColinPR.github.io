<h2>
How Did I Make it to Colorado State University's Graduate Program?
</h2>

<p>
This post is here simply to provide a background on myself so that you can get to know me. Think of it as a very brief autobiography created at the same time this site was created. Future posts are not guaranteed and will be sporadic at best!
</p>

<p> 
Right now, I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at Colorado State University (CSU) with an interest in mathematical physics, Riemannian geometry, and partial differential equations (PDEs).  Prior to my graduate work, I was an undergraduate student majoring in both general mathematics and physics at CSU as well.  But, it's worth saying that my interests were not always in these subjects.
</p>

<h2> Young Me </h2>
<p> 
We're all humans; dynamic and curious.  My interests have changed throughout my life and have happily landed me here.  When I was young, I was fascinated with how the world worked.  I don't think this is anything too remarkable seeing as children love asking "why".  But, I kept following my nose.  My dad was especially happy to do his best to explain to me what he had learned about the world.  From about as young as I can remember, he loved to give me logic questions about as much as I loved trying to answer them.  It seems like this fostered the way I naturally enjoy thinking.

As I aged and progressed towards high school I thought that I wanted to become a veterinarian.  I figured it was the job for me since I always loved animals and science.  Around this same time, I was given books by my step mother about topics in theoretical physics such as relativity and string theory.  This was also when I was involved in AP chemistry and AP physics classes in high school, and I just kept lapping up all the science I could.  The books I was given intrigued me.  I wondered about the implications of these thoughts on the local and cosmological scale. I thought to myself that it must take someone very special to handle the mathematics involved in these complex theories. So, I stuck with understanding them at a heuristic level.

<h2> Off to College </h2>
<p>
In the first half of 2012 I had finished my primary schooling and was set off to CSU to study.  I applied to a handful of schools, but I chose CSU because it just <i>felt </i> right.  Plus, as a student interested in the field of veterinary medicine, it was a great fit.  But, that didn't really last long.  Before I even landed in Colorado to sign up for classes, I had already changed my major to computer engineering.
</p>

<p>
It's a bit curious why I chose this degree path.  In high school I also spent a lot of time learning about and building computers. I never really approached programming or anything like that, but with my love of physics, I figured engineering would allow me to advance into designing chips and hardware.  My first two years at CSU were filled with introductory computer engineering courses involving programming and circuit design.  I enjoyed these courses, but I found the programming assignments more difficult than some of my colleagues and I never felt like I was great at engineering design.  The math and physics courses I took felt easy in comparison, but they didn't interest me much either. What I realized was this: I just liked the science behind it all; I wanted to know how it all <i>worked</i>.
</p>

<p>
So, immediately following my first two years, I changed my major to physics and took a summer course in linear algebra. I did not do well in this linear algebra course as it all felt like needless mumbo-jumbo--Eigen-this and eigen-that--why?  But, the following fall I took three physics courses and a statistics course and had the ride of a lifetime. That semester likely defined who I was as a student. School had always been relatively easy for me, but that semester was absolute hell!  I made it through that semester, learned a ton of physics, learned a ton of math, learned a ton about myself, and earned my highest GPA at CSU at that point. This was a turning point for me.
</p>

<h2> After the Turning Point </h2>
<p>
My nose was now firmly pressed to the grindstone and my pursuit was physics. I took another semester full of physics and with this newfound ability to work (both by myself and with colleagues), I learned quickly.  Then, a new problem arises in my mind.  It seemed like the physics courses I took handwaved quite heavily through much of the mathematics.  Let me remind you: I love to know <i>why</i> things work.  So, why is it that the mathematics we use in physics actually works? I got that physicists were okay flailing their hands, but it left me feeling empty as if there was just so much more to the story. At that same time, I was also taking an introductory course to abstract algebra which I thought was cool (but weird).
</p>

<p>
Of course, it must be that I decided to pursue mathematics in order to fill the hole left by my physics courses.  General relativity was not offered at CSU, but there was a course in differential geometry (which happened to be taught by my current advisor)! Along with more physics, I took this course and enjoyed it quite a bit.  My math foundation was very shaky though.  I really was not properly prepared for this class. It wasn't until the following semester that I learned the necessary linear and multilinear algebra I should have known prior to studying geometry.  My second course in linear algebra was easily the most conceptually difficult course I had taken at that point.  
</p>

<p>
Somehow, I still had not declared a math major.  I was also advised to not do so until I took a course in real analysis.  I jumped on that immediately, and took an elementary analysis course over the summer and found it refreshing. It felt silly knowing that I had gone about these courses in such a pedagogically incorrect order.  Either way, it worked for me; I did well in the analysis course (which was taught by a future graduate student friend of mine) and picked up another major in mathematics.
</p>

<h2> Combining the Two </h2>

<p>
Things were rolling along quite nicely. But, I was nearing the end of my undergraduate career.  In looking toward the future, I knew I wanted to pursue more of it, but I wasn't sure what.  Somewhere along the way, I had started working in a ultracold atomic physics lab. Though I do love science, I did find that experimental science was just not my calling. Being stuck over an optics bench and dialing in lasers every day was tough work.  I have the utmost respect for experimentalists! Theoretical work is honestly a cake walk in comparison.  Luckily, my advisor for that lab allowed me to work on modelling a problem that a graduate student at the time was working on experimentally.  This work led me to my first publication and it was great fun!
</p>

<p>
I worked in the lab, and signed up for a topology course.  The instructor for that course had emailed the class well before it started, and I decided to ask him if he had research opportunities. It turns out that he did! So, the summer before taking his course, I worked with another undergraduate on a mathematical problem.  Our problem had to do with sensor networks. That is, little robots whose job it is to clear a room of invaders or noxious gas. Our specific problem viewed the robots as a continuous curve, and the domains they cleared were two dimensional simply-connected regions in the plane.  
</p>

<p>
Over the next few months, I kept taking courses in the topics I found interesting. I saw more abstract algebra, more analysis, topology, and chaos. At roughly the same point in time, I was working in the physics lab and on this sensor sweeping problem.  The three of us solved the sweeping problem and I had my next publication lined up. I was also president of the Society of Physics Students chapter at CSU and was enjoying the involvement there.  It felt like we did quite a bit as a group! Everything was coming together now and it was time to do my undergraduate thesis and apply to graduate school.
</p>


<h2> The End of Undergrad </h2>

<p>
The worst part about applying to graduate school was taking the subject GRE.  My main issue was this: I didn't know whether I wanted to do math or physics.  I felt more than prepared for either, but it took me quite a while to decide on mathematics.  Math just felt like a more applicable and suitable option for me. It was rigorous, and it didn't prevent me from learning more about physics.  On the flipside, physics felt a little restrictive.  I wasn't sure if I could pursue the mathematics aspect as much as I desired.
</p>

<p>
I took the mathematics subject GRE. It was awful. Not a great day for me all together.  The test is not a great way to see the potential skill of a graduate student either. Anyways, I wasn't finding many schools to apply to since I wanted to enjoy the place I lived. Fortunately for me, CSU also didn't bother to look at subject GRE scores which benefited me heavily. And so it is that I continued on to study at CSU.
