This post is here simply to provide a background on myself so that you can get to know me.  Future posts will be sporadic and somewhat random since I have no plan for what they may entail!

<h3>
What is my story?
</h3>

<p> 
Right now, I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at Colorado State University (CSU) with an interest in mathematical physics, Riemannian geometry, and partial differential equations (PDEs).  Prior to my graduate work, I was an undergraduate student majoring in both general mathematics and physics at CSU as well.  But, it's worth saying that my interests were not always in these subjects.

We're all humans; dynamic and curious.  My interests have changed throughout my life and have happily landed me here.  When I was young, I was fascinated with how the world worked.  I don't think this is anything too remarkable seeing as children love asking "why".
